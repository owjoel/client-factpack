      "summary": "President Donald Trump announced new tariffs against China, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Korea and the British Indian Ocean Territory. Peter Bergen: It's reckless, it's absurd, and it's also everything Donald Trump said plainly he would do on the campaign trail. He says it's the same blunt-force destruction that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has imposed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Bergen: The optimist\u2019s is that this is all a feint, that other countries will capitulate or at least show that things will go back to normal. But even if they weren\u2019t, this is just posturing from the US, that posturing has consequences, even if it's Trump who's fiddling while it all burns."

      "summary": "The Democratic National Committee held a press call Wednesday to celebrate the party's victory in Wisconsin. DNC chair Ken Martin encouraged Musk to keep being the public face of the Republican Party. The chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin Ben Wikler echoed that sentiment, pointing out the destruction Musk has wrought as the head of DOGE. But Wikler also seemed to revel in the fact that Musk was still in the White House, perhaps betraying the Democratic party\u2019s tendency to focus too heavily on optics and elections rather than the substance of what Musk is destroying in between elections. The Tesla CEO appears to be toxic to regular voters if the vote tally in Wisconsin on Tuesday is any guide. But Democrats clearly need to remember that this isn\u2019t just about winning or losing elections."
