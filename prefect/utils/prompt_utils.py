        You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from the provided "

        ## Target Person
        The individual whose profile you must extract is: **{target}**

        1. **Extract structured data** based on the schema provided.

        5. **Return only extracted values in JSON format.**
        6. **If a field is not found, leave it empty (do not generate missing values or invent information).**
        7. **For lists, return an empty array `[]` if no data is found.**
        8. **Ensure proper data formatting**, e.g.:
        - Dates in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
        - Numeric values as numbers, not strings.
        - Use correct currency codes (`USD`, `EUR`, etc.).
        - Standardized industry names (`Technology`, `Finance`, etc.).
        9. **For nested fields, preserve hierarchy and structure.**
        10. **Exclude any additional commentary or explanations.**
        12. **Ensure that all key fields are filled if they can be reasonably inferred â€” especially the "
        "'ownedCompanies' field and the 'Primary Citizenship' field**

def build_merge_review_prompt(existing: dict, incoming: dict, merged: dict) -> str:
    return f"""
        You are a structured data expert. You are reviewing a merged client profile based on two inputs.

        Each profile is represented as structured JSON under the same schema.

        Your task:
        1. Compare the incoming data with the existing data.
        2. Review the merged profile.
        3. Deduplicate entries (especially for names, companies, occupations, etc.).
        4. Fix semantic duplicates (e.g., "Amazon.com, Inc." vs "Amazon").
        5. Preserve all unique and valuable information.
        6. Return ONLY the final cleaned and deduplicated merged profile, following the exact schema.

        --- EXISTING PROFILE ---
        {json.dumps(existing, indent=2)}

        --- INCOMING PROFILE ---
        {json.dumps(incoming, indent=2)}

        --- MERGED PROFILE ---
        {json.dumps(merged, indent=2)}

        ### Output:
        Cleaned merged profile in JSON only, using the provided schema.
